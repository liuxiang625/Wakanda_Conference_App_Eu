This session explores the different ways that exist to communicate as of today (November 2012) between the current version of 4D (4D v13) and Wakanda (production version 3.0). After having explored the main principles (REST, JSON, etc.) we will study this communication, which – good news! – will have to be coded. 4D code on the 4D side, and JavaScript code on the Wakanda side. It's good news because we are developpers! We want, we need, and we love to code, right?","1","3","90","4.388888888888889",

There are automated alerts (email/SMS/pager) for server breakdowns, switch/router disconnection, printer ink or database server problems. But how can we integrate these with 4D?  This session will give you the basic background you need to install and use such a system – and integrate 4D Server to monitor their status, including availability, backup and memory.    For the IT administrator, this can be fully integrated into existing systems, allowing enterprise IT departments to monitor your application without learning new tools or techniques. 4D Server’s status can be embedded into administrators’ normal monitoring screen (and further made available in the browser, iPhone, Android, etc.), and the system can furthermore display historical data, such as 4D Server’s cache usage.

The benefit of macros goes beyond time savings. Macros also reduce mistakes since they are done correctly once and create mistake free code repeatedly.  There are many features to 4D Macros, but one of the most powerful features to 4D macros that will be covered in detail is the Method Editor macros and the tagging language – the <method> tag. The <method> tag supports the calling of any 4D Project Method contained in the database. It makes possible features few can imagine can be accomplished from a macro.  Said simply, a macro in v13 is a time and money savings efficiency multiplier that does a lot more than just spit out code. If time is money, macros are gold mine in time savings. This session will contain many examples that will demonstrate techniques of reducing time consuming repetitive task down to a simple menu choice or keyboard shortcut.","1","3","0","4.277272727272727",

In virtualized environments, for example, a poorly configured storage system could slow down a database server drastically.  In many cases, it’s difficult or even impossible to convince the storage system administrator that their system is not up to speed. This session will give you the tools you need to benchmark and verify disk access requirements, and hopefully convince the IT department to upgrade their hard drives or SSDs!  To increase acceptance from enterprise IT departments, this session will focus on a (free) tool from Microsoft – SQLIO – which is used to test storage systems on MS SQL Server and MS Exchange. We’ll explain how to use SQLIO and analyze the reports it produces, allowing IT admins to verify and optimize the storage system using Microsoft tools and Microsoft best practice documents.  Furthermore, we’ll provide a 4D component to make usage even easier with a graphical interface that creates human readable reports, including charts. This component can be integrated into your system, letting you run benchmarks regularly, i.e. on weekends, or run separately. It also helps prepare DOS batch files to run on customer machines that often only have Microsoft tools installed.","1","1","10","5",

What happens if your RC software requires direct action to create a new file? It’s time to take RC integration with 4D to the next level!  The solution comes via a one-two punch: First, a generic RC component framework provides hooks for common RC tasks (create, update, rename, delete). Second, by extending this framework, tightly integrated RC components elevate 4D’s game in a big way. Don’t miss all the hits!","1","1","50","3.15",

However, clients are asking to move in this direction more and more often. Seen from the outside (which is to say from the client's point of view) it doesn't seem very complicated: ""We just need to use a browser, right?""   On the other hand, from your point of view as a 4D developer who doesn't necessarily employ more than a theoretical knowledge of the Web, the idea of having to use HTML, CSS (C-S-what?) or worse, JavaScript (!?) can be like navigating a tangled jungle, figuring out how these technologies seem to be (and are) intimately linked.   Where do you start, and toward what end?   Which methods do you apply?   Understand the vocabulary (JavaScript, Ajax, JSON, CSS...)   What do these technologies do?   Am I still using 4D?   How do I reproduce my gorgeous interface?   That's what I want to explain to you in this session, using a concretee (and personal) example to give you the clearest ideas and that you're ready for your turn to start the adventure!   Bonus: Time allowing, I'll show you the possible use of Web Area, which uses all of these technologies, right inside of 4D! ","1",,"41","4.5375",

Today, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome all hold more or less equal market share, and Safari has smaller but significant share as well.  This state of affairs presents a daunting challenge for browser extension developers, inasmuch as extension APIs are entirely proprietary with no standardization or harmonization between browsers. The Firefox APIs are a hodgepodge of XUL (a custom markup language), XPCOM (a component model), C++ (for binary components) and JavaScript (for most other purposes). The corresponding Internet Explorer APIs require elite software engineering skills, deep mastery of the Windows Component Object Model (COM) and use of C++ or C#. Chrome APIs are the simplest and require use only of standard web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  In this talk, we describe how we have used the complex and powerful Firefox and Internet Explorer APIs to implement Ancho, a cross-browser extension development framework based on the Chrome API. As a result, browser extensions implemented in pure JavaScript using the clean, modern Chrome API can run in all three major browsers (a Safari version is also planned). Without assuming any knowledge of Firefox or IE internals, we explain why we chose to use JavaScript and the Chrome API as our lingua franca and describe some of the more interesting challenges we faced in implementing Ancho.  We round out the talk with a brief survey of how popular JavaScript frameworks like Backbone and RequireJS can be used alongside the Chrome API to develop elegant software architectures for browser extensions that mirror some of the most up-to-date techniques favored by web application developers.""","1",,"10","3.1",

We will introduce MeHuNa, a Web-based online authentication framework that strikes a balance between security, usability, and portability. This architecture seamlessly combines the proven hardware security of smart cards with the universal ease of Web access through browsers, to provide a secure two-factor online authentication solution, without imposing the deployment and usability complexities generally associated with conventional smart card systems. MeHuNa relies on a proprietary browser plug-in, which provides a JavaScript API to interact with smart cards connected to the user terminal. This technology draws a new trend in the development of smart card-based Internet security solutions that go well beyond user authentication. Additional security services such as email encryption, document signature, or online smart card content management, etc., can be delivered using the familiar Web browser interface. The plug-in used in the MeHuNa framework is only a temporary solution to overcome the lack of standard API to access smart cards. The W3C is currently setting up a working group, to which Gemalto will be actively contributing, to standardize this missing API.

Or if you choose it based on the web development tools, this will mandate the user interface and storage layers.  But now a new movement has started towards a more decoupled CMS landscape. Projects like Create and JCR spearhead it, giving CMS developers previously-unseen opportunities for cross-project collaboration.  Create is the next generation user interface for content management. It provides a fully client-side content editing experience built on tools and standards like RDFa and Backbone.js. With Create, end users can stop filling forms and start communicating with their audience.  The MIT-licensed Create library provides CMS developers with a set of widgets to easily build a modern user experience. It has been built as part of the EU-funded Interactive Knowledge Systems project, which aims to boost the state of Open Source Content Management by new tools built on semantic technologies.
